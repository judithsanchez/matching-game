This repository contains the implementation of a matching/memory game using JavaScript, CSS3, and HTML5. The game's objective is to find pairs of identical elements from a list of duplicated items. The implementation includes async/await for handling API requests.

**🔍 Keywords:** JavaScript, CSS3, HTML5, async/await, API, Git, responsive design.

### 🟡 Version 2

In this version, the code has been improved to simplify the logic of the MatchingGame class. The card click handling has been updated to enhance the gameplay experience. Functions have been encapsulated to facilitate the restarting of the card comparison cycle.

- **🌱 Next version:** Add animations when the card is clicked.
- **👾 Bugs:** None that I know of, but if you find one let me know!

### 🟡 Version 1

First draft of the game. It is functional, but the delay of the second card still needs improvement.

- **🌱 Next version:** This is the initial version of the game. Although it is functional, there are areas that require improvement. One such area is the delay when flipping the second card. Additionally, the code could be further optimized for better readability.
- **👾 Bugs:** When the player clicks too quickly, the game logic does not reset.
